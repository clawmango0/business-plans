## Strategy: House Hacking + BRRRR

### The Plan

#### Step 1: House Hack (First Property)
- Buy duplex or multi-family with FHA (3.5% down)
- Live in one unit, rent other(s)
- Build equity while living for free

#### Step 2: Refinance (6-12 months)
- After appreciation + repairs
- Cash-out refinance
- Pull money out tax-free (it's a loan!)

#### Step 3: Repeat
- Use refi money for down payment on #2
- Each property flows cash
- Build portfolio

### Why This Works
- 3.5% down with FHA
- Forced appreciation via improvements
- Rent covers mortgage + expenses
- Tax benefits (depreciation)
- 1031 exchange to scale
