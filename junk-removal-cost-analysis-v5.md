## ALTERNATIVES TO CONSIDER

1. **Start solo** (you + 1 helper at $18/hr = $18 labor/job) = lower costs
2. **Pay per job** - Flat rate per load instead of hourly
3. **Subcontract** - Pay crew leaders who bring their own help

Would you like me to recalculate with a solo operator or different labor structure?
