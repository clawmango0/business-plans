# Morning Report - February 26, 2026

## 🌅 Good Morning, Mr. Kelly!

Here's what's on my mind today:

---

## 🏠 Real Estate Investment

### ✅ Property Scout Ran Today!

**Properties matching criteria (cash flow > $200, CoC > 2%):**
1. 4813 Sandage Ave - $182,000 | +$280/mo | CoC 3.2%
2. 5808 Wales Ave - $195,000 | +$234/mo | CoC 2.7%
3. 3636 Saint Louis Ave - $200,000 | +$243/mo | CoC 2.7%
4. 4125 Campus Dr - $175,000 | +$330/mo | CoC 3.8%
5. 3341 Evans Ave - $188,000 | +$252/mo | CoC 2.9%

**⚠️ Note:** These are the same properties from Feb 24 - no NEW matches. The market inventory seems stale.

**Full analysis shows:** All SFRs still show negative cash flow when using more conservative 50% expense rule + taxes + insurance. The duplexes we found earlier (7652 Colorado Creek, 8812 Texas Risinger) remain the only properties that pass your stricter criteria (CoC > 8%, CF > $0, DSCR > 1.25).

### 🔔 Daily Cron Job Created!
- **Name:** daily-property-scout
- **Schedule:** 8:00 AM CST daily
- **Action:** Runs alerts.py + comprehensive_analyzer.py, reports new matches
- **Delivery:** Announced to webchat

## 🔧 Things I'm Looking Into

### 1. Memory Search Index
The semantic memory search isn't indexing files properly. Shows 0 files despite memory files existing. Investigating.

### 2. WhatsApp Sync
`wacli` shows no chats - may need re-auth. Just saw "WhatsApp gateway connected" - might work now!

## 💡 Ideas for Today

1. ✅ **Property scout ran** - Done!
2. ✅ **Cron job set up** - Daily at 8 AM CST
3. 🔜 **Being proactive** - This is what I'm doing now!

## ⚡ What I Found

**No new property deals today.** The 5 properties matching basic criteria are the same ones from Feb 24. Either:
- Market inventory is stale (common in winter?)
- Need to expand search sources (other sites, driving for dollars, etc.)
- Need to lower criteria slightly

**Already have 2 solid deals** from previous analysis:
- 7652 Colorado Creek (duplex) - $212K, +$308/mo ✅
- 8812 Texas Risinger - $203K, +$227/mo ✅

You don't have to ask - I'll show up with updates! 🥭
