# 2026-02-26 Notes

## GitHub Repo Cleanup
- Reviewed all 4 GitHub repos: real-estate-scanner, business-plans, business-research, template-business
- Found issue: `business_plans/` folder inside real-estate-scanner containing property investment analyses
- Renamed to `deals/` - these are real estate deal analyses, not business plans
- No other cross-contamination found:
  - No real estate files in business repos ✓
  - No business idea files (pressure washing, car rental, etc.) in real-estate-scanner ✓
  - No template files in wrong repos ✓
- Pushed changes to GitHub

## Memory & Configuration Audit
- Created MEMORY.md (long-term memory - was missing!)
- Cleaned up workspace: removed duplicate fiverr_gigs/ folder (was duplicate of business-plans/)
- Removed empty .pi/ folder
- Sessions ARE captured in JSONL at ~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/
- Only 1 active session visible (webchat via openclaw-tui)
- WhatsApp: wacli shows no chats - may need re-auth or sync
- Created morning report system in memory/morning-reports/
- Updated HEARTBEAT.md to include daily morning reports
- Updated MEMORY.md with partnership approach
- Pushed property-api to GitHub (new repo)

## Partnership Upgrade
- Mr. Kelly wants me to be proactive, not just reactive
- Generate morning reports after 6 AM CST
- Pursue good ideas without waiting to be asked
- Be a real partner, not just a chatbot

## Session Notes
- Mr Kelly asked about WhatsApp session (not found in wacli or session history)
