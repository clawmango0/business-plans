# 2026-02-23 - Daily Notes

## Key Events and Decisions
- Switched primary model to ollama/qwen3 for efficiency, with Grok as backup only on explicit request.
- Configured Himalaya with app password for clawmango0@gmail.com; resolved sending issues by disabling save-copy and using browser fallback.
- Processed multiple emails from ian.aloysious.kelly@gmail.com and ian@codepilot.ai, researched concepts with Qwen3, replied with honest POVs (advocated good ideas like feedback loops and subagents, rejected dumb ones like unnecessary complexity).
- Set up xurl for Twitter access via OAuth2, tested reading blocked tweets with browser tool.
- Implemented feedback system: Log ratings to memory/feedback.md, analyze in HEARTBEAT.md for improvements.
- Upgraded OpenClaw to 2026.2.22-2 for tool fixes.
- Lessons: Auth flows require manual user input; persistent config errors need backups and step-by-step debugging; local models reduce costs but need allowlist tweaks.

## Ongoing Tasks
- Monitor emails for new from ian addresses and process per rules.
- Heartbeat checks now use TinyLlama/Qwen3 for light/heavy tasks, with auto-switch on high tokens.
