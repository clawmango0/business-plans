### 🔥 Barrett Linburg (@DallasAptGP) - OZ Expert

**OZ Myth Busted - 37% Cash-Out in 2 Years:**
> "The biggest misconception about Opportunity Zones is that your money is locked up for ten years. We just closed a cashout refinance that will send about **37% of our investor's original equity back as a tax-free distribution. Within two years of closing.**"

**OZ Capital Gains Requirement:**
> "You must have a capital gain to be an OZ investor. Landing shortly in a place where there are likely more unrealized gains than anywhere else right now"

**AI in Real Estate:**
> "A recent Keyway survey of 150 CRE pros showed only **8% of RE firms have AI-ready data infrastructure**"

## Insights for Mr. Kelly

1. **OZ Strategy Works**: Not locked 10 years - can refinance after 2 years and get 37% back
2. **Need Capital Gains**: OZs require existing capital gains to invest (not just cash)
3. **AI Opportunity**: 92% of CRE firms lack AI-ready infrastructure - competitive advantage possible
4. **Unrealized Gains**: Barrett targeting areas with high unrealized gains (tech hubs?)
