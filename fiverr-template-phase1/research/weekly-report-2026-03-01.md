# SOPCentral Weekly Research Report
**Week of March 1, 2026**

---

## Task 1: Competitor Check

**Note:** Web search unavailable this week (API not configured), using existing research data.

- **Dental SOPs Market:** Fiverr freelancers dominate at $10-110, but mostly generic. Dental consultants charge $500-5,000+ but offer personalized services. **Gap:** No dedicated dental SOP marketplace with software integrations.
- **HVAC/Pool/Cleaning:** Less competition digitally than dental - opportunity to be early mover. Generic business SOP sellers don't target these verticals specifically.
- **Pricing Sweet Spot:** $50-100 on Fiverr for perceived quality. SOPCentral can undercut premium ($150-350) while out-delivering budget ($10-25).

## Task 2: Content Inspiration (3 Ideas)

1. **"The $500/hr Question: Are Your Procedures Worth More Than Your Time?"** - ROI-focused hook for small business owners. Tie to vacation/peace of mind.

2. **"I Analyzed 28 SOP Templates on Fiverr - Here's What's Missing"** - Differentiation content. Show gaps (no industry-specific, no bundles, no implementation guidance).

3. **"5 SOPs Every Pool Service Company Needs Before Summer Rush"** - Niche-specific seasonal content. Captures search intent during peak season prep.

## Task 3: Niche Monitoring

- **Dental:** Strongest demand, highest competition for attention. Compliance bundles (HIPAA + OSHA) = differentiator.
- **HVAC:** High demand, underserved digitally. Seasonal peaks (summer/winter). Safety procedures = high value.
- **Cleaning:** Volume play, lower price point but high repeat potential. Move-out deep cleans = annual peaks.
- **Pet Care:** Growing market, emotional stakes = willingness to pay premium for safety/emergency SOPs.
- **Pool Service:** Often overlooked, good for case study content ("From Chaos to Clockwork").

## Summary

**Key Insight:** No competitor offers industry-specific SOP + Proposal + Client Intake bundles. SOPCentral's multi-template system is the differentiation. Priority: HVAC and Cleaning next expansion.
