*Researched: March 1, 2026*

---

## DENTAL PRACTICE SOPs

### What's on Fiverr
- Only 1 gig specifically targets dental (generic SOP + handbook)
- General SOP pricing: $5-295
- Most are generic, not industry-specific

### What Dental Practices Need
- Sterilization/Infection Control (CDC-compliant) - NON-NEGOTIABLE
- Patient intake procedures
- Dental billing/insurance processing
- OSHA compliance procedures
- Equipment maintenance
- Appointment scheduling
- Emergency protocols
- HIPAA compliance

### Gap Opportunity: ✅ SIGNIFICANT
- No dedicated dental SOP templates on Fiverr
- CDC has free checklists (not SOPs)
- Heavy regulation = willingness to pay premium

---

## POOL SERVICE COMPANY SOPs

### What's on Fiverr
- "Pool service" exists but mostly website design, not SOPs
- No dedicated pool service SOP gigs
- Notion has $29 templates

### What Pool Companies Need
- Weekly cleaning procedures
- Chemical balancing (chlorine, pH, alkalinity)
- Equipment inspection/maintenance
- Pool opening/closing procedures
- Water testing protocols
- Customer service procedures
- Route optimization

### Gap Opportunity: ✅ MODERATE-STRONG
- Templates on Notion/ClickUp but not comprehensive
- Many small pool companies exist
- Geographic demand (Texas!)

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Dental: ✅ YES - Strong
- High regulatory burden = pay premium
- Almost no Fiverr competition
- CDC/OSHA compliance adds value

### Pool Service: ✅ YES - Good
- Less regulated = easier to create
- Weak template competition
- Good for small business owners
