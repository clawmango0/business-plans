## Objection Handling Scripts

### "This isn't what I expected"

> "I totally get it — let me make sure we get this right for you. What specifically weren't you expecting? I'll add a free edit to make sure it meets your unique needs. That's what I'm here for!"

### "It's too expensive"

> "I understand budget is a concern. If the Premium tier isn't working for you right now, I can offer you the Standard tier at today's price — same quality template, just without the custom video walkthrough. Would that work better for you?"

### "I need it faster"

> "Rush orders are no problem! I can priority this for you — delivery in 24 hours instead of 3 days. Just let me know and I'll make it happen."

### "The template doesn't fit my industry"

> "No worries at all — that's an easy fix! I'll customize it specifically for your industry at no extra charge. Can you tell me a bit more about your business so I can make it perfect?"

### "I want a refund"

> "I'm really sorry this didn't work out as you'd hoped. Before we process a refund, let me make one final adjustment — I'll add a free edit to ensure it meets your unique needs. If it's still not right, I'm happy to process the refund. What would you prefer?"

### "You're taking too long"

> "I apologize for the delay — let me get this to you right now. I'll priority your order and have it to you within the next few hours. Thanks for your patience!"

---

## Sales & Satisfaction Objection Handling (EXTENDED)

### "Can you make it cheaper?"

**Response:** 
> "I totally get it — budget matters! Right now you're getting the Premium tier with custom template + video tutorial. If you'd like, I can offer you the Standard tier instead — same quality, just without the custom template. It's $20 less and still includes the video walkthrough. Would that work better for you?"

**Alternative:**
> "I can't do lower on price, but I can throw in an extra revision or a bonus template at no charge. Would that help?"

---

### "I found a cheaper template elsewhere"

**Response:**
> "That's totally fair! Here's what I'd say — with my templates, you're getting more than just a document. You get the video tutorial explaining how to use it, revisions if you need changes, and direct access to me if you have questions. Plus, I can customize it specifically for your business. That personal touch is hard to find with cheaper options. Does that help?"

---

### "I'm not sure I need this"

**Response:**
> "That's completely understandable! Here's the thing — most of my clients felt the same way before they got their template. They were spending hours figuring things out or winging it. With this template, you'll have a professional system in place that saves you time and looks amazing to your clients. What's the main thing holding you back?"

---

### "Let me think about it"

**Response:**
> "Absolutely, take your time! Here's what I'll do — I'll hold this at today's price for 24 hours. If you decide you want it after that, just let me know and I'll check availability. No pressure either way!"

**Follow-up (if no response):**
> "Hey! Just following up — did you have a chance to think it over? I'm still happy to help if you have any questions!"

---

### "Your competitor offers more"

**Response:**
> "That's a fair comparison! Here's what makes our templates different: (1) I personally respond to every message, (2) I include video tutorials showing exactly how to use the template, and (3) I offer revisions until it's perfect for your business. It's not just a template — it's ongoing support. Does that help?"

---

### "I don't have time for this right now"

**Response:**
> "I get it — you're busy running your business! That's actually why people love these templates — they save you time. You don't need to do anything except fill in the blanks. I can even have it ready for you to review whenever you have 10 minutes. Want me to get started anyway?"

---

### "Will this actually work for my specific situation?"

**Response:**
> "Great question! What specific situation are you dealing with? I've created templates for [similar businesses]. The template is designed to be customizable, and I'm happy to make adjustments. What's your unique situation?"

---

### "I need it for a different industry"

**Response:**
> "No problem at all! One of the best things about these templates is they're fully customizable. I can adapt the framework to fit your industry — just tell me what field you're in and I'll make it work. That's included at no extra charge."

---

### "The reviews are fake / You're new"

**Response:**
> "I totally understand the skepticism! I'm new to Fiverr but not new to this work — I've helped dozens of businesses with their operations. If you're not satisfied, I'll make it right or refund your money. Want to take a chance? You have nothing to lose."

---

### "I can get this for free"

**Response:**
> "You're right, there are free templates out there! Here's the difference: free templates are generic, often outdated, and there's no one to help if you get stuck. With my template, you get something custom to your business, a video showing how to use it, and me personally to answer questions. Sometimes free costs more in the long run. What do you think?"

---

### "I want to see samples first"

**Response:**
> "Absolutely! I can share a sample template with you — it's the general version, not customized for any specific business. Would you like me to send that over? Then you can see the quality before deciding."

---

### "Your delivery time is too long"

**Response:**
> "I can absolutely get this to you faster! I offer rush delivery — I can have it to you in 24 hours instead of 3 days. It's just $15 extra for priority handling. Want me to make that happen for you?"

---

### "I'm not good with technology"

**Response:**
> "That's actually perfect then! That's why I include the video tutorial — I walk you through everything step by step. Even if you're not tech-savvy, you'll be able to use it. And if you get stuck, just ask me! I've helped plenty of people who said the same thing, and they loved the result."

---

### Closing Techniques

**The Value Close:**
> "Here's what you'll get: a professional template that saves you hours, a video tutorial showing exactly how to use it, and my personal support. That's worth [price]. Ready to get started?"

**The Scarcity Close:**
> "I only have a few slots available each week — want me to reserve one for you?"

**The Risk Reversal Close:**
> "If you're not 100% satisfied, I'll refund your money. No questions asked. You have nothing to lose. Ready?"
