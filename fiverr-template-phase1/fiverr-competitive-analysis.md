## 3. COMPETITIVE STRATEGY ANALYSIS

### What Works (Patterns):

**Pricing:**
- Entry-level: $10-$25 (budget-friendly, high volume)
- Mid-tier: $40-$110 (sweet spot for professionals)
- Premium: $150-$350 (top-rated sellers, complex deliverables)
- Sweet spot appears to be $50-$100 for quality perceived value

**Delivery Times:**
- Standard: 1-7 days
- Rush options available as extras
- 24-hour delivery mentioned by some sellers

**Revisions:**
- Typically 1-3 revisions included
- Unlimited revisions rarely mentioned
- Revision policy often unclear in gig titles

**Positioning Approaches:**
- "Professional" and "business" are most-used keywords
- Industry-specific positioning works (GMP, manufacturing, HR)
- Software-specific (Notion, PowerPoint, Word, PandaDoc)
- Results-focused ("investor-ready", "functional")

### What's Missing (Gaps to Fill):

1. **Client Intake Forms:** Almost no dedicated gigs for client intake packages
2. **Integrated Solutions:** Few sellers offer bundled packages (SOP + Proposal + Intake)
3. **Industry-Specific Bundles:** Most sell generic templates
4. **Instruction/Training:** Sellers don't typically include how-to guides
5. **Template + Strategy:** No one combines templates with implementation guidance
6. **Niche Focus:** Missing freelancer-specific, service business-specific templates

### What's Overdone:

1. Generic PowerPoint/Word templates (massive competition)
2. Notion templates (saturated market)
3. Basic document formatting
4. One-size-fits-all approaches
