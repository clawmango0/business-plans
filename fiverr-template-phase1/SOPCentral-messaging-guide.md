# 1. Brand Voice

**Tagline:** "Professional Templates, Simplified."

**Voice Personality:**
- **Helpful expert** — You know templates, you make them simple
- **Straight shooter** — No fluff, no jargon, no overpromising
- **Professional but approachable** — Like a knowledgeable colleague, not a stuffy consultant

**Tone Guidelines:**

| Situation | Tone |
|-----------|------|
| First gig impression | Confident, clear, benefit-driven |
| Responding to buyers | Warm, responsive, solution-oriented |
| Explaining what's included | Specific, detailed, reassuring |
| Handling concerns | Understanding, patient, value-focused |
| Closing the sale | Direct but not pushy |

**Language Style:**
- ✅ Use "you" and "your" — speak directly to the buyer
- ✅ Action verbs: get, create, streamline, build, deliver
- ✅ Short sentences, scannable lists
- ✅ Numbers where possible (e.g., "5 templates," "2 revisions")
- ❌ Avoid: corporate buzzwords, excessive exclamation marks, empty promises
- ❌ Avoid: sounding like a faceless corporation

**Writing Formula:**
> [Benefit] + [What it is] + [Who it's for]

Example: *"Stop winging it. Get a client intake process that actually works — so you look professional from the first conversation."*

# 6. Pricing Psychology

**Why These Price Points Work:**

---

### Entry Tiers ($15-25)

**Psychology:**
- Low risk = easy decision
- "Try before you buy" — gets foot in door
- Buyers feel safe purchasing

**When to use:**
- New gigs building reviews
- Simple, quick deliverables
- Add-ons to larger orders

---

### Core Gigs ($35-75)

**Psychology:**
- Sweet spot for Fiverr buyers
- Perceived as quality (too cheap = suspicious)
- Room for upsells via gigs 2, 3, or custom orders

**When to use:**
- Main deliverables (SOPs, intake packages, proposals)
- The bread and butter of your Fiverr income
- Professional positioning without scaring off small budgets

---

### Premium / Bundle ($100-150+)

**Psychology:**
- "Good / Better / Best" anchoring
- Buyers often choose middle option
- Shows confidence in value

**When to use:**
- Multi-gig packages
- Rush orders
- Custom development work

---

### Fiverr-Specific Tips:

1. **Start cheap to build reviews, then gradually raise prices** — Classic Fiverr growth strategy

2. **Use $5 as a loss leader only** — Great for getting first reviews, but hard to sustain

3. **Anchor with your premium** — If your best package is $150, the $75 option feels like a deal

4. **Bundle discounts** — Offer 10-15% off when buying multiple gigs (e.g., "Get SOPs + Intake Package together for $120 (save $15)")

5. **Gig extras** — Add fast delivery ($10-15), additional revisions ($5), or custom branding ($20) as upsells

---

# 7. Common Objections & Responses

---

### Objection 1: "This is too expensive for me right now"

**Response:**
> I totally get it — budgets are tight when you're growing. Here's what I'd suggest: start with just the core template at [$X]. Once you see the value and land a few clients, you can add more later. The templates are designed to grow with you.

*(Then offer a lower-tier option or suggest an alternative gig)*

---

### Objection 2: "I can find free templates online"

**Response:**
> You definitely can! But here's the difference — free templates are generic and often missing key sections. These are built from real client work, so they include the things that actually make a difference: clear instructions, professional formatting, and the structure that converts. Plus, you don't waste time figuring out what goes where. I'd say it's worth the investment — but you can start with the basic package to test it out.

---

### Objection 3: "I'm not sure how to customize these"

**Response:**
> No worries at all — every template comes with simple, clear instructions. You'll get editable files (Google Docs or Canva), so you just replace the placeholder text with your own. I've had clients who weren't tech-savvy at all, and they were done in 15 minutes. Plus, unlimited revisions mean I'll help you until it looks right.

---

### Objection 4: "I need this urgently / tomorrow"

**Response:**
> I can definitely help with that! For rush delivery, I offer a 24-hour expedited option for [$X] extra. Let me know if that works, and I'll get it prioritized.

*(If you can't accommodate, be honest but offer an alternative: "My standard timeline is 3 days. If that's too long, I can point you to another seller who offers rush — just let me know.")*

---

### Objection 5: "Can you make this more specific to my industry?"

**Response:**
> Absolutely — that's exactly what I do. When you order, just tell me your industry and the specific situation, and I'll tailor the templates accordingly. I have experience with [list relevant industries: consultants, agencies, coaches, photographers, etc.]. No extra charge for customization — it's included.

---

### Objection 6: "I want to see samples first"

**Response:**
> Great question! Here are a few non-client examples of my work: [link to portfolio samples or attach 1-2 sanitized examples]. These show the style and quality I deliver. Let me know what you think — happy to answer any questions!

---

### Objection 7: "My business is different — these won't work for me"

**Response:**
> That's what customization is for! These templates are frameworks — I build them to fit your specific workflow, not the other way around. Tell me how your process works, and I'll adapt everything. I've done this for [X] clients across [industries], and every one was different. That's the whole point — templates that *actually* fit your business.
